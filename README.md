# Obsidian Grammarly Plugin 

This is a plugin for [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) which adds [Grammarly](https://grammarly.com) support directly in your editor.

**NOTE**: This plugin is a work in progress. It will be submitted to "Community Plugins" at a later time.

## Installation 

Quick starting guide for installing the plugin:
- Download the latest release here from Github
- Put the extracted directory in the .obsidian/plugins folder in your Vault (it might be a hidden folder)
- Open Obsidian, go to "Community Plugins" and enable "Obsidian Grammarly Plugin".

## Usage

There are two ways to use this plugin.

1. Click on the Grammarly logo in the left ribbon.
2. Open the command palette and run the "Enable Grammarly" command.

Grammarly will now be enabled for the remainder of the session. At the moment you have to quit Obsidian to get rid of it.

## About
This plugin is pretty simple.
It includes the Grammarly Editor SDK so that you get a Grammarly button in the lower left corner of your editor window.
You also get underlines and the typical in-place substitutions that Grammarly provides.

## Roadmap
Obsidian Grammarly Plugin is far from done.
This is more of a proof-of-concept version at this stage.

### 1.0.0
- [ ] Support for logging in to your own Grammarly account (for premium features)
